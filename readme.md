### Typing in Go

Go is a staticly typed language, meaning that a string can't magically become an int, and an int can't magically become a string.

To declare a variable, one usually does something like this:
```go
var x float64 = 7.6
var y, z string = "abc", "123"
```
Now, x will always be a 64-bit floating point number, and y and z will always be a string. (NB: Declaring multiple vars with comma notation is amazing.) If one tries to change a type, one will get an error.
```go
var a int = 7
a = "harambe"
// cannot use "harambe" (type string)
// as type int in assignment

```
There are some shortcuts; Go will guess the variable type if not declared.
```go
var x = 7.6
var y = "abc"
```
Go will assume that 7 is a float, since there is a decimal between numbers, and that y is a string, since it is surrounded by double quotes.

This can be made even shorter with one of our favorite Go features: the `:=` operator.
```go
x := 7.6
y := "abc"
```

### Type Conversions
[Ref](https://golang.org/pkg/strconv)
#### Strings to Numbers
Go does allow us to change a few types with the `strconv` package. We used a couple of methods:
```go
xf, err := strconv.ParseFloat(x, 64)
```
`ParseFloat()` takes a string as its first argument and the width (in bits) of the float to be returned. It returns two values: a float of the specified width, and an error message. Note how we assign TWO variables to a single method. We actually skipped the error checking by using the nifty `_` variable name.
```go
xf, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(x, 64)
```
Using `_` in place of any variable name in Go causes it to be ignored, and no memory allocated for it. So if we wanted to ONLY check for errors, we could instead say:
```go
_, err := strconv.ParseFloat(x, 64)
```

#### And back again
After doing some math with our floats, we needed a string to print to the screen. For that, we used `FormatFloat()`, which is even more convoluted:
```go
ans := strconv.FormatFloat((xf * yf), 'f', -1, 64)
```
`FormatFloat()` returns a string, and takes in four arguments:
1. The float to be parsed (in this case a product)
* A byte representing the output format. We use the byte `'f'`, `102` in decimal or `01000110` in binary, to request a simple floating point number without any exponential notation.
* A precision value, in this case the number of digits after the decimal. Our value of `-1` lets Go decide how precise it needs to be in order to be accurate.
* The bit width of the original float, in this case 64.

There are some easier methods with integers (`atoi` may be familiar to C fans) and strings.

### Reading Files in Go

To serve up our `index.html` page, we had to do a tiny bit of os-level stuff. We used two additional native packages, `os` and `io/ioutil`.

The `net/http` server package of Go writes a slice of bytes to the response body, so we couldn't natively just say, "Hey go, give them this file on the server!". To serve up the `index.html`, we used the following:
```go
func IndexHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  index, err1 := os.Open("index.html")

  if err1 != nil {
    panic(err1)
  }

  data, err2 := ioutil.ReadAll(index)

  if err2 != nil {
    panic(err2)
  }

  w.Write([]byte(data))
}
```
`os.Open()` returns a file pointer and an error message, and takes in a string representing a relative path file location.

`ioutil.ReadAll()` returns a byte slice (`[]byte`) and an error message, and takes in a file pointer.

`http.responseWriter.Write()` appends the given `[]byte` to the response body.

In this example, we don't really "catch" errors, but instead use `panic()` to immediately halt operation if an error is returned. It is the best-named function of all time.
